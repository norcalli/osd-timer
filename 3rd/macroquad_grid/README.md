# real readme coming soon

## NOTES

- the draw_rect function's impl does not match the draw_text function's

-- draw_rect takes in (x, y) as top left corner

-- draw_text takes in (x, y) as bottom left corner of text

the rect is below and to the right of the given xy pair
the text is above and to the right of the given xy pair
